In this project, I will summarize some fragmentary knowledge that I have automatically absorbed in the past few years. I will continue to brush Leetcode, study English and take ielts every day (my English foundation only barely passed high school), study and organize in-depth knowledge, and learn well in the undergraduate courses of computer self-examination that I have applied for recently. And update my daily learning progress, if you also have the fire of Silicon Valley in your heart, we can light it together, go forward with me boy.

I only recommend the websites or learning content that I have used and think the quality is OK, which is also the focus of my current study and review. In terms of technology, except for the handed down classics, all the contents are the latest, especially the Android technology will not be involved in a few years ago, because it is easy to outdate, so please keep pace with me. The specific learning log will be submitted to the project in the form of a separate file. This log is mainly used as a personal learning record and is not responsible for the correctness of the results and learning effect.

This content will be as it is not responsible for strategy, is to urge their daily upward can also provide some Suggestions and avoid detours, you no matter I succeed or fail to believe can be to guide to the future generations, at the same time, in the form of automatic translation provides to the international friends of reference, such as there is too a rookie and translation is not in place of the keyboard man light spray, please.Welcome friendly advice and guidance.
