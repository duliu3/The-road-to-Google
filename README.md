# The-road-to-Google
这是一个普通工程师的谷歌梦之旅

This is the journey of an ordinary engineer in pursuit of the Google dream.

**梦之始**

The beginning of the dream

我是一个很菜很普通的安卓工程师，只有高中学历，还是个矮穷直，快三十岁了，在这个看脸的世界里躺平了好几年了，然而身处在这卷王的世界里，身心都不得自由，所以我也开始卷了。和大家一样，我心中也有一团不灭的硅谷之火，我希望有一天能在这个世界上最好的公司工作，写最飘的代码，喝最烈的酒，看最美的风景，住最大的房子，撩最美的妹子。

我将在本项目中总结几年来躺平自动吸收到的一些零碎知识，坚持开始刷leetcode，坚持每天学英语考雅思（我的英语基础只有高中勉强及格），坚持研究有深度的知识并整理，坚持把报考不久的计算机自考本科课程学好。并且更新我每日的学习进度，如果你心中也有硅谷之火，我们可以一起点燃它，和我一起前进吧少年。
